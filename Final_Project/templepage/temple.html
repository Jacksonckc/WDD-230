            that a temple would be built in south Florida was made by church
            president Thomas S. Monson on October 3, 2009, during the church's
            semi-annual general conference.[5] The temple was announced
            concurrently with the Brigham City Utah, Concepción Chile, Fortaleza
            Brazil and Sapporo Japan temples. It is the second temple
            constructed in Florida and the first in the heavily populated
            southern part of the state. The state's other temple, in Orlando,
            was completed in 1994.

            The Hong Kong China Temple is the only temple to have had a steeple
            and angel Moroni statue permanently removed as part of a renovation.
            The steeple stood atop the building from the time of its dedication
            in 1996 until its renovation closure in 2019.

            late 2003, the temple was dedicated on February 10, 2008[1] and was
            the first temple dedicated by Thomas S. Monson as the church's new
            president. The Rexburg Idaho Temple was the third LDS temple in
            Idaho. (Later in 2008, a fourth Idaho temple was dedicated in Twin
            Falls.) The temple sits south of the Brigham Young University–Idaho
            (BYU–Idaho) campus on the south side of Rexburg. Prior to its
            completion, BYU–Idaho had been the only LDS Church-owned university
            without a temple adjacent to its campus.

            <span class="bold_char">Temple History:</span><br />The Salt Lake
            Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. At
            253,015 square feet (23,505.9 m2), it is the largest Latter-day
            Saint temple by floor area. Dedicated in 1893, it is the sixth
            temple completed by the church, requiring 40 years to complete, and
            the fourth temple built since the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo,
            Illinois, in 1846.[1] The temple was closed in December 2019 for a
            general remodelling and seismic renovations that are anticipated to
            take approximately four years.[2]
